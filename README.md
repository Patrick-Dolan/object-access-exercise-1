# Object Access Exercise 1

## Description
This is an exercise designed to help practice getting information from deeply nested objects in JavaScript.

## How to use
Clone down the project and open the index.html in your browser. (I recommend Chrome as I built it for that)
Once the page is open, follow the instructions on the web page and make changes in the scripts.js file and refresh the page to check the console for your answers.
